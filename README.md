# Kai's Software Emulator History.

## 2020 - Kobash

KOBASH is a simple command line utility written in Python 3.8, it was used as a little test for all the future programs
that the Kai's Software Foundation would create.

## 2020 - Kobash-C 

KOBASH-C is a recreation of KOBASH in C++.

## 2020 - CMD4

CMD4 is a simple prompt app that tries to mimic the classic command prompt
by adding features like custom commands, file checking, file writing, and more.



## 2020-2021 - KTerminal

KTerminal was a light, easy to use Python 3.9 Terminal
that was perfected and published on May 15th.
With over 15 Commands, and support for extra commands,
The terminal was built to support over 50 types of compilers.

## 2021 - KCS

KCS was a cool terminal that was written in C#, but never finished.

KCS was going to be a neatly-organized, fast command prompt. 

## 2021 - Kux

Kux. The Command Processor that started it all.

Kux is a high-level, very customizable command Processor based off of the bash
command processor.

Kux contained a very easy to modify, and very organized structure called an LKernel. Which is like a local KERNEL.

Kux also had very easy to use Lua Libraries which handled a bunch of tedious tasks such as,

- Memory management
- Input
- HTTP requests
- Data
- System Calls
- Filesystem calls
- Symbol File Calls
- Directory information
- Lua loading
- System development
- And Operating System specific calls.

The Kux LKernel is now currently used for DOSVA, FreeKSD, KobashRM, KuxNE, SCDisks, KBox, Craptitude and DKux.

Kux is now currently coming out with a NEW Kernel written in the C Programming language.

## 2021 - FreeKSD

Coming quickly after Kux was released, FreeKSD is a Modification to Kux which changes most of the
default system utilities to be much more efficient and faster.

FreeKSD was more Production-ready than Kux was; containing many more features than Kux, it was
the GO-TO Kux edition which was the fastest and most convenient.

## 2021 - Craptitude

Craptitude is a Binary disk mount system written in C, and Lua.

Craptitude is a very advanced system for mounting Lua image files for using them.

## 2021 - KBox

KBox is a dropped MS-DOS based Operation System (Such as FreeKSD, GKux, and more).

## 2021 - SCDisks

SCDisks is a recreation of the Craptitude mount system. 

SCDisks contains better logic, while still maintaining a user-friendly base.

## 2021 - KuxNE

KuxNE is a Kux edition which removes the 'no-error' checks.

## 2021 - KobashRM

KobashRM is a recreation of the Kobash command processor.

## DOSBash, CDOSBash, MiniDOS, and DOSva 

These command processors aren't like the Kux command processor, DOSva is based off of Kux, while the other
two are using their own codebases.

These are just reskins of the SH command interpreter.
